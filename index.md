### Stretch Challenges

- Give the navigation a background color and have it be fixed to the top of the page so that it scrolls with the user. You will want to study what z-index means in case you encounter any issues when you scroll.
- Introduce a new font family from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Research CSS animations and see how you could implement some ideas when hovering over buttons or navigation items **Mouse over `Get Started` button on `index2.html`**
